Monasca Log API
===============

The monasca-log-api project has a RESTful HTTP service called the
Monasca Log API. Through this API users are able to send logs from entire
cloud.

This guide covers the concepts in the Monasca Log API.
For a full reference listing, please see:
`Monasca Log API Reference <https://docs.openstack.org/api-ref/monitoring-log-api/>`__.

We welcome feedback, comments, and bug reports at
`storyboard/monasca <https://storyboard.openstack.org/#!/project_group/59>`__.

Intended audience
=================

This guide assists software developers who want to develop applications
using the Monasca Log API. To use this information, you should
have access to an account from an OpenStack Compute provider, or have
access to your own deployment, and you should also be familiar with the
following concepts:

*  Monasca services
*  RESTful HTTP services
*  HTTP/1.1
*  JSON data serialization formats

End User and Operator APIs
==========================

The Log API includes all end user and operator API calls.
The API works with keystone and, at the monent, uses custom RBAC to
enforce API security.

API Versions
============

Following the Newton release, every Nova deployment should have
the following endpoints:

* / - list of available versions
* /v2.0 - the first version, permitted only single log to be send per request
* /v3.0 - the next version, allows sending multiple logs at once
